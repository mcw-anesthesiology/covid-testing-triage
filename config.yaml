          - AIDS (CD4 below 200, or CD4 percentage below 15%)
          - Congenital (primary) immunodeficiency disorders
          - Generalized malignancy treatment:
            - Alkylating agents
            - Antimetabolites
            - Radiation therapy
          - On large doses of corticosteroids for 14 days or longer:
            - 20 mg or more per day of prednisone or equivalent
            - 2 mg/kg or more per day of perdnisone or equivalent
          - Solid organ transplant patients
          - Bone marrow transplant patients who are taking certain immunosuppressive drugs
            - BMT patients are considered \"immune competent\" 2 years after their treatment if they are
              **NOT** on steroids, biologics. If they are on steroids, or medications for graft
              vs host disease, then their risk is increased similar to the solid organ transplant
              patient

          ## Patient must meet **ALL** of the following criteria to have isolation precautions discontinued when accessing services at a Froedtert Health facility:

          1. Resolution of fever for 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medications
          2. Improvement in other symptoms (complete resolution not required)
          3. Must be 28 days after first positive test

          **If patient remains asymptomatic, do not retest for procedures or hospital admission for 90 days following a positive test.**

          NOTE: Retesting 90 days after a positive test is not recommended because a positive test in an asymptomatic person during the 90 days after illness represents persistent shedding of viral particles.
          If a recovered person becomes symptomatic during the 90 day window, then retesting may be warranted.

          ## Patient must meet **ALL** of the following criteria to have isolation precautions discontinued when accessing services at a Froedtert Health facility:

          1. Resolution of fever for 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medications
          2. Improvement in other symptoms (complete resolution not required)
          3. Must be 20 days after first positive test

          **If patient remains asymptomatic, do not retest for procedures or hospital admission for 90 days following a positive test.**

          NOTE: Retesting 90 days after a positive test is not recommended because a positive test in an asymptomatic person during the 90 days after illness represents persistent shedding of viral particles.
          If a recovered person becomes symptomatic during the 90 day window, then retesting may be warranted.
