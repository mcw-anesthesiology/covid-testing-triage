## Patient must meet **ALL** of the following criteria to have isolation precautions discontinued when accessing services at a Froedtert Health facility:

1. Resolution of fever for 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medications
2. Improvement in other symptoms (complete resolution not required)
3. Must be 10 days after first positive test

**If patient remains asymptomatic, do not retest for procedures or hospital admission for 90 days following a positive test.**

NOTE: Retesting 90 days after a positive test is not recommended because a positive test in an asymptomatic person during the 90 days after illness represents persistent shedding of viral particles.
If a recovered person becomes symptomatic during the 90 day window, then retesting may be warranted.
